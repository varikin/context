# Context Free Memes

My coworkers and I had a brilliant idea† at lunch one day.
Make a list of all our quotes that are made better through lack of context.
We then took the idea further.
Lets do a Google Image search for the quote and add the quote to the first result.

## BOOM!

Context Free Meme was born. Well, conceived. 
After a gestation period of about 4 days, it was born.

## Details

This fun little program will take a quote or file of quotes and create memes.
For each quote, it will perform a Google Image search‡ and loop through the results
until it gets a workable image (PIL doesn't have a cow).
It then adds the quote to the image and saves it in the current directory. 


† Many great ideas are had over lunch

‡ With safe search on since this is for work
